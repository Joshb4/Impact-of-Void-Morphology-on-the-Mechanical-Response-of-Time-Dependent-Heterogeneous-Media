This code generates voids of polygonal geometry. 
The input parameters begin with the Matrix M which is done when the code reads the COORDSALLAGG.xls file. 
The second parameter is irregularity. 
a higher irregularity value will increase irregularity.
The third parameter is spikyness.
This controls the angles at the vertices.
A higher value will create smaller angles at the vertices.
The fourth parameter is Alpha.
This controls the ellongation of the voids.
A higher value will make the voids less elongated and more compact.
The fifth parameter is numverts.
This controls the number of vertices each void has.
The sixth parameter is offset.
This controls how far apart the voids are from each other.
The seventh parameter is the target air void area percentage the code will generate.
This code will generate 2 output files named Vertices_of_Polygones_Voids and Line_connector_of_Polygones_of_Vertices_of_voids.
