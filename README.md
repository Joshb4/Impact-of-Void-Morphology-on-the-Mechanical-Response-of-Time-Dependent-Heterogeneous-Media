# Impact-of-Void-Morphology-on-the-Mechanical-Response-of-Time-Dependent-Heterogeneous-Media

The codes presented are all designed to generate a random amount of air voids with differing geometry and amount dependent
on the desired output.
Each opens and reads the COORDSALLAGG.xls file in each folder to plot the aggregates. 
They will output a file(s) in which the contents must be combined in another text file to be converted into a Python script.
Insert the outputs from the code and input into the sample file provided. 
This script will then be run in Abaqus CAE.
