This code generates voids of elliptical geometry. 
The input parameters begin with the Matrix M which is done when the code reads the COORDSALLAGG.xls file.  
The second parameter (nstep) is used as a step in determining the radius of each air void. 
The radius generation is a vector ranging from 0:pi/nstep:2*pi 
The third parameter is the target air void area percentage the code will generate.
This code will output a file named Origin_of_Void_Ellipses in the folder.
